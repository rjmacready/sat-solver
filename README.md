# Tiny SAT Solver

Emphasis on code simplicity, rather than performance, at least for now

Inspired by: 

http://sahandsaba.com/understanding-sat-by-implementing-a-simple-sat-solver-in-python.html

## Running benchmarks

You can download .cnf files from here http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html, extract the files such that the Makefile can see them (for instance, extract uf20-91.tar.gz into a directory "uf20-91", make sure the directory is included in the SRC variable)

## TODO

Abstract further (?...), implement iterative version
